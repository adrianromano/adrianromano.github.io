# What do you need to get hired by Google?

This is a job requirement analysis of the Google Company. The dataset for the analysis contains information such as the Job Title name, Job Locations, Job Responsibilities, Minimum requirements and Preferred qualifications. The data was taken from the Google Jobs Site and was made publicly available at the Kaggle website.  

The project were done with Python and written in a Jupyter Notebook. I also included the requirement analysis of jobs that are related to Data, Analytics or Machine Learning along with the analysis of the overall Job Titles at Google.

The image below shows an example of the result from the analysis:

* Here is the analysis of what Field of Study are required for Data Related Jobs at Google:
