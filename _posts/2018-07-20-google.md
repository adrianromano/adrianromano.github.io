# What do you need to get hired by Google?
This is the Google job requirements project analysis.

The dataset contains information such as the Job Title name, Job Locations, Job Responsibilities, Minimum requirements and Preferred qualifications. The data was taken from the Google Jobs Site and was publicly made available at Kaggle.  

The project was done with Python and written in a Jupyter Notebook. I also included the requirement analysis of jobs that are related to Data, Analytics or Machine Learning along with the analysis of the overall Job Titles at Google.

* Here is an example of Field of Study requirement for the data related jobs:
