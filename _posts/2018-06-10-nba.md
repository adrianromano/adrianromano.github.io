This is an analysis project of exploring the data for 2017/2018 NBA regular season.

The dataset was taken from the Basketball Reference website that can be accessed from [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2018_per_game.html).

The data contains all the player's stats such as three point shots made, field goals percentage, total rebounds and much more. It also lists the age, positions and team name for each player.

Here is an example of the analysis from the project:
