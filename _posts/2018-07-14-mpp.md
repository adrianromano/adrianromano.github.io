This is the Microsoft Professional Program Capstone challenge hosted by Microsoft and DrivenData. The goal of the project was to build a Regression Model to predict heart disease mortality rate based on a number of given features such as county areas, demographics and socioeconomic information of thousands of individuals. The data was made publicly by the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (USDA ERS).

I compared and evaluated five different models in terms of their RMSE value. The five models that were chosen to be evaluated are:

- Ridge (L2 Regularization)
- Lasso (L1 Regularization)
- Gradient Boosting
- XG Boost
- Light Gradient Boosting

The model with the lowest RMSE value was chosen and placed me at rank 9th out of 376 total participants for my initial submission.

In addition to the model submission, I was also required to make an analysis report of the project.

The submission of my prediction model and report granted me this Data Science Microsoft Professional Program Certificate:
