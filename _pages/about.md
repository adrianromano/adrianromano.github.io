Hi! This is Adrian here.

I was born and raised in the city of Jakarta, Indonesia and spent most of my teen life studying in local International Schools before I went abroad to study in the US.

I am a junior, up and coming Data Scientist who is very passionate in working with data specifically on Machine Learning, Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualizations.

I currently live in Minneapolis, MN working as a Data Analyst in a company of Medical Devices at Plymouth, MN.

In 2017, I obtained a B.S degree in Statistics from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. I have been taking online courses and certificates ever since then to broaden my knowledge in Data Science. Some of the ones I completed include:

- Data Science Specialization, Johns Hopkins University on Coursera
- Data Science Microsoft Professional Program, Microsoft on edX
- Python, R, SQL Data Science Bootcamp, Udemy
- Data Science for Business , IBM
- Big Data Fundamentals, IBM

In addition to that, I also took part in some Data Science project competitions from Kaggle during my leisure time as a hobby.

R and Python are the programming tools that I most often used to do my Data Science work. Feel free to explore my portfolio to browse some of these projects.

Outside of my technical "nerdy" life, I also have other hobbies that I often do in my leisure time such as playing fingerstyle guitar, pick-up basketball, snowboarding and video games (Currently plays *God of War* on PS4 and *Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* on Nintendo Switch ;) )

My life journey does not end here though! I also have some future plans and goals that includes:

- Obtain a Master Degree in Data Science and/or MBA
- Broaden my knowledge of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- Tackle some more certificates and competitions (especially for Big Data projects)
- Broaden my knowledge in Forex Trading
- Learn to sing and play the piano
- Travel around the World
- Eat good foods!!

and so much more!

That’s about it for my introduction! Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-r-angkawijaya-717b53161/) or shoot me a dm if you want to discuss opportunities, collaboration or just share about anything in general. I’m always happy to talk!

Thanks for reading !
