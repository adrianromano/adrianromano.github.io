Hi! This is Adrian here.

I currently live in Minneapolis, MN and working as Data Analyst in a company for Medical Devices at Plymouth, MN.

I am a junior, up and coming Data Scientist who is very passionate in working with data specifically on Machine Learning, Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualizations.

I was born and raised in the city of Jakarta, Indonesia and spent most of my childhood studying in an International School before I went abroad to study in the States.

On 2017, I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics from the University of Minnesota but I know my learning life did not just stop there! I have been taking online courses and certificates ever since then to satisfy my hunger in learning. Some of them include:

- Data Science Specialization, Johns Hopkins University on Coursera
- Data Science Microsoft Professional Program, Microsoft on edX
- Python, R, SQL Data Science Bootcamp, Udemy
- Data Science for Business , IBM
- Big Data Fundamentals, IBM

In addition to that, I also have been taking part in some projects competitions on Kaggle and am not planning to stop anytime soon.

Outside of my technical nerdy life, I also have other hobbies such as:

- Fingerstyle Guitar
- Pick up basketball
- Snowboarding
- Video games (Currently plays God of War on PS4 and Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on Nintendo Switch)

I also do have future plans and goals, some of them include:

- Obtain a Master Degree in Data Science and/or MBA
- Broaden my knowledge of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- Tackle some more certificates and competitions especially for Big Data projects
- Learn how to sing and play the violin
- Travel around the World!

And that’s about it! Feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-r-angkawijaya-717b53161/) or get in touch if you want to discuss opportunities, collaboration or just share about anything in general. I’m always happy to talk!
